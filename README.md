# checkloop

**Autonomous multi-check code review using Claude Code.**

**Writeup:** [Autonomous Multi-Check AI Code Review](https://alexmarquardt.com/ai-tools/checkloop-autonomous-code-review/)

Asking an AI to "review everything" spreads it thin. `checkloop` runs focused, single-concern checks in sequence — readability, then DRY, then tests, then security, and so on — where each check builds on the previous one's cleanup. Splitting a long function reveals duplication; removing the duplication exposes a security gap that was hidden in the repeated code. Multi-cycle runs repeat the full suite on the improved codebase, catching issues that only become visible after the first round of fixes.


## Token Usage

Each check is a full Claude Code session — reading files, making edits, running tests. A basic plan (5 checks) on a medium-sized project typically uses 200K–500K tokens. Thorough or exhaustive runs with multiple cycles can reach several million tokens. Be careful!


## Install

Requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexander-marquardt/checkloop.git
cd checkloop
uv sync
```

## Usage

Run with `uv run checkloop` from anywhere. Both `--dir` and a mode flag are required — either `--review-branch <ref>` (clone mode, the recommended default) or `--in-place` (run directly in `--dir`):

```bash
# Review the remote main branch — checkloop clones the target into
# ~/checkloop-runs/<project>-<iso-timestamp>/ and reviews origin/main there
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main

# Review a feature branch from origin
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch feature/my-work

# Thorough plan on the review branch
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --plan thorough

# Exhaustive — all 31 checks, repeat twice
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --plan exhaustive --cycles 2

# Super-exhaustive — exhaustive plus infrastructure audits and a meta-review
# that writes a recommendations report (occasional deep audits only)
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --plan super-exhaustive

# Pick specific checks manually (overrides plan)
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --checks readability security tests

# Use your own plan file
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --plan ./my-plan.toml

# Preview without running
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --dry-run

# Run against the working tree directly (including uncommitted changes) —
# this is the legacy behaviour; no clone is made and commits land in --dir
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --in-place

# Only check files changed on the review branch vs main/master
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch feature/x --changed-only main

# See what Claude is doing in detail
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main -v

# Add a specific check on top of a plan
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --plan thorough --checks cleanup-ai-slop

# Use a different Claude CLI (e.g. Bedrock-backed)
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --review-branch main --claude-command claude-bedrock
```

### Clone mode vs in-place mode

By default (`--review-branch <ref>`) checkloop never modifies your working tree:

1. It makes a hardlink-backed `git clone --local` of the target repo into `~/checkloop-runs/<project>-<iso-timestamp>/` — disk cost is effectively zero on the same filesystem.
2. It runs `git fetch origin --prune` inside the clone (against the local source, no network), then checks out the requested ref (preferring `origin/<ref>` when it exists) in **detached-HEAD** state so commits can't accidentally be pushed upstream.
3. It rewrites the clone's `origin` URL to the source repo's real remote (e.g. the GitHub URL), so `git push origin <branch>` from inside the clone later goes straight to GitHub rather than to the user's local source directory.
4. It creates a scratch branch named `<review-branch>-cl-<iso-timestamp>` (e.g. `main-cl-2026-04-21T10-30-45Z`) and commits every change there.
5. It imports the target's Claude auto-memory (if any) from `~/.claude/projects/<original-slug>/memory/` into the clone's project slug, so the check sessions inherit the same project context — prior incidents, user preferences, pending follow-ups — that you would see when running Claude in the original repo. **The import is read-only**: any memory the check sessions write during the run lands in the clone's slug and is intentionally orphaned when the clone is removed. Checkloop never modifies the original repo's memory.
6. When the run finishes the terminal prints a single copy-paste prompt for a Claude session in your **original** repo — that Claude inspects the scratch branch in the clone (read-only, no fetch into the original repo), and re-applies any genuine improvements as fresh edits in the original repo on new branches, then tests, commits, opens PRs, and merges through the original repo's normal workflow. All git activity beyond inspection happens in the original repo, never in the clone.

This means you can keep working in your actual project directory while checkloop reviews a separate snapshot of it. The clone directory is also a timestamped backup — clones older than 14 days are pruned automatically.

Set `CHECKLOOP_STATE_HOME=/some/other/path` to put the clones somewhere other than `~/checkloop-runs/`.

`--in-place` preserves the old single-directory behaviour: no clone, commits land on a `checkloop-<iso-timestamp>` scratch branch inside `--dir`, and uncommitted/untracked files in your working tree are reviewed too. Use it when you want to review in-flight work, or for non-git directories.

#### Why `--dir` instead of cloning from GitHub directly?

A natural question: if checkloop is going to clone the target anyway, why not just take `--repo owner/name` and clone from GitHub? The current design intentionally requires a local checkout. The trade-offs that drove that choice:

- **Speed and zero network.** `git clone --local` is hardlink-backed — disk cost is effectively zero on the same filesystem, and the startup `git fetch origin --prune` runs against the *local source*, not GitHub. A fresh GitHub clone would be slower (especially on big repos) and require network on every run.
- **No auth setup.** Reading from a local checkout works the same for public and private repos and never has to deal with HTTPS tokens, SSH keys, or GitHub App credentials. The remote URL is read once from the local repo's `git config` so the post-run flow can still reference it.
- **Auto-memory keying.** The Claude auto-memory directory is keyed by the *local path's* slug (`~/.claude/projects/<slug-of-original-dir>/memory/`). Without a local path there is no slug to look up, and the check sessions would lose the prior-incident context, user preferences, and pending follow-ups that the user accumulated by working in the repo locally.
- **`--in-place` needs the local checkout outright.** That mode reviews uncommitted and untracked files, which only exist on disk.
- **Reviewing what you actually have.** Pointing at `--dir` means the review starts from whatever local state you're working from, which is usually what you actually want to review — the branch you just rebased, the staging you just pushed, the local commit you have not yet pushed. A GitHub-only model would force the round-trip of "push first, then review."

If a "review a teammate's PR I haven't checked out" workflow becomes a regular need, a `--repo owner/name --review-branch <ref>` mode that does a fresh GitHub clone could be added additively. The current `--dir` mode is not replaced by that hypothetical addition; it remains the fast path.

### After a run — let Claude review and adopt the work

checkloop never pushes or merges anything itself, and the clone directory is treated as read-only review material — no git operations should originate there. When the run finishes the terminal prints a single copy-paste prompt aimed at a Claude session running inside your **original** repo. That session inspects the scratch branch in the clone with `git -C <clone-dir> log/diff/show` (without fetching it into the original repo), applies project standards (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`), and — for the improvements that are worth keeping — re-applies them as fresh edits in the original repo on new branches, runs the project's tests and linters, then commits, pushes, opens PRs, and merges through the repo's normal workflow. The clone's own commits are never imported; only the *ideas* cross over.

If you'd rather adopt manually, inspect the clone with `git -C <clone-dir> log/diff` and re-implement the improvements directly in your original repo. If you don't want any of it, `rm -rf <clone-dir>` removes the entire run.

In `--in-place` mode the scratch branch already lives in your repo, so the flow is just: review (manually or via Claude), then push and PR through your normal workflow.

To make `checkloop` available globally (without `uv run`):

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/alexander-marquardt/checkloop.git
```

## Execution Plans

Execution plans are TOML files that define which checks to run and which model to use for each check. They live in the `execution_plans/` directory at the project root. Four ship pre-populated — choose one with `--plan`:

| Plan | Checks | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **basic** (default) | 5 checks | Core code quality — readability, DRY, tests (plus test-fix/test-validate bookends) |
| **thorough** | 19 checks | Adds docs, docs-accuracy, security, authorization/access-control, performance, error handling, type safety, derived-value consistency, architecture layer separation, idiomatic implementation, cross-check coherence, a post-modification `tests-for-diff` pass, a `suppressed-failures` sweep, and a final `commit-audit` advisory |
| **exhaustive** | 31 checks | Everything in thorough — includes edge cases, complexity, idiomatic implementation, deps, logging, concurrency, concurrency test coverage, state-locality & cache coherence, a11y, frontend data-flow correctness, API design, rationale capture, and code cleanup |
| **super-exhaustive** | 41 checks | Exhaustive plus infrastructure audits (check-config, dead-code, observability, schema-validation, secret-leakage, feature-flags, fixture-drift), a **contributing-conformance** audit (checks this run's diff against the target project's own `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`CLAUDE.md` rules), a **recurring-issues** audit (mines GitHub issue/PR history for repeated defect classes), and a final **meta-review** that writes a recommendations report. Meant for occasional deep audits. |

> `migration-safety` is shipped as an on-demand check, not included in any default plan. Run it with `--checks migration-safety` for projects that change persisted schema — SQL/relational migrations (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) **or** document/search-index stores (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, MongoDB) and other on-disk format changes — or add it to your own plan file. It is excluded from the defaults because most runs don't touch a persisted-schema surface at all; when yours does, it audits locking/backfill/rollback for SQL and versioned-index/alias-swap plus old-format upgrade tests for document stores.

Every plan includes the `test-fix` (first) and `test-validate` (last) bookend checks to ensure the test suite is green before and after the review.

Use `--checks` to pick individual checks, or `--all-checks` as a shortcut for `--plan exhaustive`.

## Per-Check Model Selection

Each plan file specifies which Claude model to use for each check. The pre-populated plans assign models based on the cognitive demands of each task:

- **Sonnet** (faster, used for most checks) — pattern-matching tasks like readability, DRY, tests, docs, docs-accuracy, error handling, types, complexity, deps, logging, accessibility, API design, `suppressed-failures`, and code cleanup.
- **Opus** (deeper reasoning, used selectively) — multi-layer analysis tasks like security, access-control (authorization/IDOR/tenant-isolation), concurrency, concurrency test coverage, state-locality & cache coherence, frontend data-flow correctness, performance, and edge cases, where subtle issues span multiple code layers. Security checks stay on Opus deliberately — Fable's cyber safety classifiers can decline a security-focused prompt and return an empty result (the same reason `access-control` stays on Opus, not Fable).
- **Fable 5** (`claude-fable-5` — deepest reasoning, used for the cross-cutting boundary checks) — the whole-codebase, source-of-truth analyses where layer boundaries are at stake: `architecture-boundaries`, `derived-values`, `coherence`, and the deep advisory passes `meta-review` and `recurring-issues`. These reason about which layer *owns* a value (e.g. a frontend that should consume a backend-computed value rather than re-derive it), where the extra capability most changes the verdict. Fable costs roughly 2.6× Opus per check and runs longer turns (hence the larger idle timeouts on those checks), so it is reserved for this cluster rather than applied across the board.

### Automatic model fallback

Fable 5 is not available to every account or region. When a check's configured model is unavailable, checkloop **automatically falls back** to a still-available model (Opus first, then Sonnet) for that check, prints a one-line warning, and keeps going — so a gated model degrades gracefully instead of leaving the check silently empty. The unavailable-model attempt fails in milliseconds with no tokens spent, so the fallback costs effectively nothing. The committed plans therefore keep Fable as the *preferred* model for the boundary checks; where it isn't accessible they run on Opus instead, with the same source-of-truth prompt. A global `--model` override is treated as an explicit choice and is never second-guessed.

The `--model` flag overrides the per-check model for all checks (it accepts aliases like `sonnet`/`opus` or full IDs like `claude-fable-5`):

```bash
# Use plan defaults (sonnet for most; opus for security/access-control/concurrency/state-locality/perf/edge-cases; fable for the boundary checks)
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --plan thorough

# Force all checks to opus (slower but deeper analysis everywhere)
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --plan thorough --model opus

# Force all checks to sonnet (fastest, good for quick passes)
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --plan thorough --model sonnet
```

## Per-Check Reasoning Effort

Separately from the model, each check can set a **reasoning effort** level (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`) via an `effort` key in the plan file — passed straight through to the `claude` CLI's `--effort` flag. Effort controls how much the model thinks and how many tool calls it makes; it is *not* monotonic (cranking everything to `max` tends to overthink and rarely beats `xhigh` for these task shapes), so the plans tune it per check rather than running everything at the CLI default:

- **`medium`** — the mechanical, pattern-matching checks (readability, DRY, idiomatic, docs, types, deps, logging, etc.). These don't need deep deliberation, so `medium` saves tokens and time at little cost to recall. This is the bulk of every run.
- **`high`** — the deeper Opus reasoning checks (perf, edge-cases, concurrency-testing, observability, state-locality, frontend-data-flow) and the `test-fix` bookend.
- **`xhigh`** — the correctness-critical and source-of-truth checks where extra deliberation earns its keep: `security`, `access-control`, `concurrency`, and the boundary and deep-advisory cluster (`architecture-boundaries`, `derived-values`, `coherence`, `meta-review`, `recurring-issues`).

Checks that set no `effort` use the CLI default. The `--effort <level>` flag overrides every check at once — `--effort medium` for a fast, cheap pass, `--effort xhigh` to push the whole suite deeper:

```bash
# Plan defaults: medium for mechanical checks, high/xhigh for the reasoning ones
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --plan thorough

# Force a fast, cheaper pass — every check at medium effort
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --plan thorough --effort medium
```

## Available Checks

| Check | Plan | Model | What it does |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| `test-fix` | bookend | sonnet | Runs the existing test suite and fixes any failures in source code. Always runs first. |
| `readability` | basic | sonnet | Naming (fixes names that lie or are overloaded across layers; avoids cosmetic rename churn), function size, module/class docstrings for design strategy. No behaviour changes. |
| `dry` | basic | sonnet | Finds repeated logic, extracts helpers, separates mixed concerns into focused modules. |
| `tests` | basic | sonnet | Behaviour-driven tests for happy paths, edge cases, complex logic correctness. Unit tests with mocks, integration tests separately. |
| `docs` | thorough | sonnet | README, config docs. Module-level docstrings for design strategy, class docstrings for intent. Function docstrings only where name+signature don't tell the full story. |
| `docs-accuracy` | thorough | sonnet | Cross-references CLI help, README examples, error messages, and API docs against actual code. Fixes factual inaccuracies — wrong defaults, renamed flags, stale file paths. Does not add documentation. |
| `security` | thorough | opus | Injection, hardcoded secrets, input validation. Won't change CORS/retry/auth config without a clear vuln. |
| `access-control` | thorough | opus | Authorization, not authentication: verifies each object-fetch and state-change checks the caller may act on *this* resource — IDOR/BOLA, tenant isolation, function-level role gaps, client-side-only enforcement, mass-assignment/privilege escalation. Adds a regression test where an authenticated-but-unauthorized caller is rejected. Self-skips projects with no authenticated multi-actor surface. Stays on opus (not fable) for the same refusal reason as `security`. |
| `perf` | thorough | opus | N+1 queries, O(N²) algorithms, blocking I/O, unnecessary allocations. Selective caching for expensive repeated computations. |
| `errors` | thorough | sonnet | Centralized error handling for external services. Only where code can meaningfully respond. No wrapping code that can't fail. |
| `types` | thorough | sonnet | Type annotations, replace `Any`/untyped code, runtime validation at API boundaries (Annotated/Pydantic/Zod). |
| `derived-values` | thorough | fable | Finds frontend code that re-derives values the backend already computes. Fix is to add missing values to existing API responses — not create new API calls or recompute on the frontend. Trivially deterministic computations are excluded. |
| `architecture-boundaries` | thorough | fable | Discovers the project's architectural layers, checks that dependencies flow in one direction, and fixes violations — upward imports, leaking internals, shared state coupling, mixed-layer modules, circular dependencies, and source-of-truth inversion (a higher layer recomputing/synthesizing/overriding a value the lower layer authoritatively produces, even when the import direction is legal). Skips single-layer projects. |
| `coherence` | thorough | fable | Reviews the codebase as a whole after all other checks and fixes cases where checks worked against each other — conflicting changes, cumulative over-engineering, style drift, redundant layering, broken call chains, and load-bearing deletions made by `cleanup-ai-slop`. |
| `tests-for-diff` | thorough | sonnet | Runs after the behavior-modifying checks. Diffs this run against the scratch-branch base, identifies every changed unit of behavior, and writes a regression test for any unit that lacks one. The earlier `tests` check audits pre-existing coverage; this one closes the gap that opened during the run. Does not modify source code. |
| `suppressed-failures` | thorough | sonnet | Sweeps this run's diff for silenced failure signals — skipped/`only`/`xfail` tests, `type: ignore`/`@ts-ignore`/`as any`, `noqa`/`eslint-disable`, swallowed `except: pass`/empty catches, and assertions weakened to force green — and restores the signal (fixing the root cause) or requires a narrow, specifically-justified suppression. Distinguishes legitimate `skipif`/invalid-input-test suppressions. |
| `commit-audit` | thorough | sonnet | Final advisory pass. Classifies every commit this run produced as behavior+test / bug-fix+regression-test / readability-win / docs-only / behavior-without-test / fix-without-test / net-neutral churn, prints the table to the terminal, and writes `.checkloop-commit-audit.md` with the recommended action per commit. Does not revert or rebase. |
| `edge-cases` | exhaustive | opus | Off-by-one, null/empty inputs, overflow, Unicode edge cases. |
| `complexity` | exhaustive | sonnet | Flatten nested conditionals, reduce cyclomatic complexity. |
| `idiomatic` | thorough | sonnet | Replaces verbose, hand-rolled code with the language's built-in / stdlib equivalent when behaviour is exactly preserved — e.g. `os.path` chains → `pathlib`, `try/except KeyError` → `dict.get`, index loops → `enumerate`/`zip`. Narrower than `complexity` (control flow) and `readability` (naming). No new dependencies. |
| `deps` | exhaustive | sonnet | Remove verified-unused deps, flag vulnerable/outdated packages. |
| `logging` | exhaustive | sonnet | Structured logging at entry points. No debug logging on hot paths. |
| `concurrency` | exhaustive | opus | Race conditions, missing locks, async/await correctness. |
| `concurrency-testing` | exhaustive | opus | Flags multi-user projects (web apps, APIs, e-commerce) that lack tests simulating concurrent access to shared state. Writes correctness-under-concurrency tests for critical operations (inventory, balances, reservations). Skips single-user projects. |
| `state-locality` | exhaustive | opus | Coherence of shared state across workers/replicas/tabs: false persistence (instance-local storage presented as shared config), per-worker caches with no cross-instance invalidation, and caches that store a backend-failure degrade value as fresh instead of keeping last-known-good. Litmus: if two instances could diverge after independent legitimate operations, it's a defect. Skips single-instance/stateless projects. |
| `accessibility` | exhaustive | sonnet | Semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav, colour contrast (WCAG AA). |
| `frontend-data-flow` | exhaustive | opus | Data-fetching/effect correctness in component frontends (React et al.): stale/missing effect deps, out-of-order fetch races, missing cleanup (post-unmount updates, leaked subscriptions/timers), response→state→refetch loops, entangled effects, StrictMode double-fire, unhandled loading/error states. Correctness, not style. Skips projects with no client-side effect layer. |
| `api-design` | exhaustive | sonnet | Consistent naming, HTTP methods, error formats, pagination. |
| `rationale` | exhaustive | sonnet | Ensures every non-trivial module, function, config knob, complex code block, and invariant-pinning test carries a brief explanation of *why* it exists — placed in a docstring, code comment, or doc file as appropriate. Investigates via `git log`/blame/PR references before writing; leaves `TODO(rationale): …` markers and reports them as gaps when the rationale can't be recovered. Documentation-only — no code changes. |
| `test-validate` | bookend | sonnet | Re-runs the full test suite after all checks. Fixes any regressions. Always runs last. |
| `cleanup-ai-slop` | exhaustive | sonnet | Removes unnecessary noise: redundant docstrings, unnecessary logging, misleading error handling, coverage-driven tests. |
| `check-config` | super-exhaustive | sonnet | Audits that the project's test, lint, type-check, and CI infrastructure match the stack. Scaffolds Playwright for browser-facing apps that lack E2E coverage, wires up coverage gates, and ensures CI runs the tools that exist locally. |
| `dead-code` | super-exhaustive | sonnet | Removes unused exports, orphaned files, unreachable branches, stale feature-flag references, and old commented-out blocks. Uses `ts-prune`/`vulture`/`staticcheck` where available. |
| `observability` | super-exhaustive | opus | Checks that auth, payments, data mutations, external API calls, and background jobs have structured logs, metrics, and reach an alerting path. Adds what's missing using the project's existing observability stack. |
| `schema-validation` | super-exhaustive | sonnet | Ensures every external boundary (HTTP handlers, webhooks, queue consumers, external API responses, env/config) parses through a schema (Zod/Pydantic/etc.), not a raw type assertion. Verifies webhook signature checks. |
| `secret-leakage` | super-exhaustive | sonnet | Scans the repo and built output for API keys, tokens, private keys, connection strings with passwords, PII in logs, and server secrets bundled into client code. Flags commits that need rotation. |
| `migration-safety` | on-demand | opus | Reviews persisted-schema changes for production safety. SQL: locking risk, concurrent-index creation, destructive-change staging, chunked backfills, rollback paths, transaction boundaries. Document/search stores (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch/Mongo): versioned-index + alias-swap instead of in-place mapping rewrites, an old-format→new-code upgrade test, chunked reindex backfills, and isolating an engine-version bump from logic changes. Run with `--checks migration-safety`; not in any default plan. |
| `feature-flags` | super-exhaustive | sonnet | Finds ghost flags (referenced, not defined), orphan flags (defined, not referenced), fully-rolled-out flags with dormant branches, and conflicting flag gates. |
| `fixture-drift` | super-exhaustive | sonnet | Finds test mocks and recorded fixtures that no longer match the real code or external APIs — silently-passing mocks, deep-chain patches, stale HTTP recordings, leaking mocks without teardown. |
| `contributing-conformance` | super-exhaustive | fable | Reads the target project's own contributor rules **in full** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, …) and audits this run's diff against them — the project-specific rules the generic suite can't know, including the ones buried past the rule-injection size cap. Scoped to diff-relevant rules (ignores process/CI/merge-procedure guidance). Writes violations to `.checkloop-contributing-audit.md` when any are found; the post-run review prompt tells the adopting agent to evaluate and act on each. Advisory — no code changes. Self-skips when the project has no such files. |
| `recurring-issues` | super-exhaustive | fable | Mines the project's GitHub issue/PR history (via `gh`) for defect classes that keep coming back — reopened issues, revert chains, repeated regressions in one area — clusters them with citing issue/PR numbers, and for each cluster specifies the regression test that would have caught it (plus an advisory architectural note when a test alone won't fix it). Writes `.checkloop-recurring-issues.md`. Advisory — no code changes. Self-skips when `gh` is unavailable/unauthenticated or the repo has no GitHub remote. |
| `meta-review` | super-exhaustive | fable | Reads the codebase and the set of existing checks, then writes `.checkloop-recommendations.md` with prioritised suggestions for domain-specific checks or tests that the generic suite doesn't cover. No code changes. The report is printed to the terminal after the run completes. |

## Writing Your Own Plan Files

You can write your own plan files to define any combination of checks, model assignments, and effort levels. A plan file is a TOML file. Each `[[checks]]` entry takes an `id` (required), a `model`, an optional `idle_timeout` (seconds), and an optional `effort` (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`); omitted fields use sensible defaults:

```toml
[tier]
name = "security-audit"
description = "Security-focused review with deep analysis"

[[checks]]
id = "test-fix"
model = "sonnet"
effort = "high"

[[checks]]
id = "security"
model = "opus"
effort = "xhigh"

[[checks]]
id = "concurrency"
model = "opus"
effort = "xhigh"

[[checks]]
id = "edge-cases"
model = "opus"
effort = "high"

[[checks]]
id = "test-validate"
model = "sonnet"
effort = "medium"
```

Point `--plan` at it:

```bash
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --plan ./security-audit.toml
```

The pre-populated plans in `execution_plans/` use the same format — copy and modify them as a starting point.

## Customizing Checks

Each check is a Markdown file in `checks/` with YAML frontmatter (`id`, `label`) and a prompt body:

```markdown
---
id: readability
label: "Readability & Code Quality"
---

Improve naming (variables, functions, classes), but only where the current name
is genuinely confusing...
```

To customize a check, edit the `.md` file directly — no Python changes needed. To add a new check, create a new `.md` file in `checks/` and reference its `id` in a plan TOML or via `--checks`.

The `prompt_templates/` directory contains boilerplate injected into every check at runtime:
- `full_codebase_scope.md` — prepended to every check (unless `--changed-only` is used)
- `commit_message_instructions.md` — appended to every check

In addition, at the very top of every check prompt, checkloop **injects the target project's binding rules verbatim** from `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (whichever exist, in that priority order). Each file is capped at 8 KB so a long `CONTRIBUTING.md` does not bloat every prompt. The injected block is wrapped in a `PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES` header that tells the agent these rules override any generic check guidance. This means project-specific rules — no-AI-attribution, test-for-every-behaviour-change, no-net-neutral-churn, proprietary-data scoping — are physically present in the agent's context without depending on the agent to side-quest a read of the standards file.

## Why Multi-Check Works

A single "review everything" prompt overwhelms the model. Dimension-specific checks let it focus deeply on one concern at a time. And cycling produces compounding improvements:

1. **Readability** check renames a confusing variable and splits a long function
2. **DRY** check can now see that two of those smaller functions are nearly identical
3. **Security** check catches an injection vulnerability that was hidden inside the duplicated code
4. **Tests** check writes tests for the cleaned-up API surface, which is now testable

Each check builds on the work of the previous ones.

### Large codebases

Incremental, focused checks are especially important for large codebases. Claude has a finite context window, and a project with thousands of files can't fit all at once. Asking it to "review everything" forces it to read hundreds of files before making a single edit — filling context with code it may never need while leaving no room for the actual work.

Each checkloop check operates incrementally: read a handful of related files, make focused edits, commit, move on. The check-specific prompts guide Claude toward this pattern rather than attempting a full codebase scan. A readability check might read one module, improve its naming, and move to the next — instead of cataloguing every variable name in the project before touching anything. This keeps context available for reasoning and editing rather than exhausting it on upfront indexing.

The result is that checkloop scales to projects that would otherwise stall a single-pass review. A 50K-line codebase that times out when you ask Claude to "review it all" becomes manageable when broken into focused, incremental passes.

## Checkpoint & Resume

If `checkloop` is interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash, terminal close), it saves a checkpoint after each completed check. On the next run with the same check selection, it detects the incomplete run and offers to resume:

```
Previous incomplete run detected:
  Started     : 2026-03-08T14:30:00+00:00
  Progress    : cycle 1/2, check 3/6 completed
  Next check  : tests

  Resume from checkpoint? [y/N] (defaulting to N in 10s):
```

If you don't respond within 10 seconds, it starts fresh. Use `--no-resume` to skip the prompt entirely.

The checkpoint file (`.checkloop-checkpoint.json`) is saved in the target project directory and is automatically cleaned up when the suite completes successfully.

## Convergence Detection

When running multiple cycles (`--cycles N`), `checkloop` can stop early once the codebase stabilises. After each cycle it measures what percentage of total tracked lines were modified. If that percentage falls below the `--convergence-threshold` threshold (default 0.1%), the loop exits. This requires the project directory to be a git repo. Set to 0 to disable.

```bash
# Run up to 5 cycles, but stop early if changes drop below 0.5%
uv run checkloop --cycles 5 --convergence-threshold 0.5
```

## Options

```
--dir, -d DIR          Project directory to check (required)
--review-branch BRANCH Branch (or any git ref) to review. Required unless
                       --in-place is set. Clones --dir into
                       ~/checkloop-runs/<target>-<iso-timestamp>/ and checks
                       out this ref there. Prefers origin/BRANCH over a local
                       branch of the same name.
--in-place             Run directly in --dir instead of cloning. Commits still
                       land on a disposable scratch branch but they modify the
                       working tree in --dir. Mutually exclusive with
                       --review-branch.
--plan, -p PLAN        Plan name or path to a TOML plan file.
                       Pre-populated: basic, thorough, exhaustive (default: basic).
--checks CHECK [...]   Manually select checks (overrides --plan)
--all-checks           Run all 31 checks (same as --plan exhaustive).
                       For the 35-check super-exhaustive plan, use
                       --plan super-exhaustive explicitly.
--cycles, -c N         Repeat the full suite N times (default: 1)
--idle-timeout SECS    Kill after N seconds of silence (default: 600). The
                       threshold is consulted, not absolute. The watchdog
                       inspects the process tree before killing:
                         - descendants alive AND CPU-busy → uncapped (only
                           --check-timeout bounds runtime)
                         - one signal (descendants OR CPU, not both) → extend
                           to 2x then kill
                         - neither signal → never killed; sub-agent turns
                           and context compaction routinely socket-block for
                           1h+ with no kernel-visible activity, and we cannot
                           tell that apart from a genuine hang. --check-timeout
                           is the wall-clock safety net for this tier.
                       A status=compacting SDK event also suppresses the kill
                       in every tier until compaction completes.
--check-timeout SECS   Hard wall-clock limit per check (default: 0 = no limit).
                       Unlike --idle-timeout, kills even actively-running
                       checks. This is the only bound on the no-signal tier
                       (parent socket-blocked on API), so set it for
                       monorepos where Claude routinely delegates to a
                       sub-agent for 20+ minutes per turn.
--max-memory-mb MB     Kill a check if its child process tree exceeds this RSS
                       (default: 8192). Set to 0 to disable.
--system-free-floor-mb MB
                       Kill the running check if host-wide free memory drops
                       below MB (default: 500). Safety net for swap-thrash
                       stalls that can require a hard reboot. Set to 0 to
                       disable.
--no-caffeinate        Do not hold a macOS power assertion during the run.
                       By default, on macOS, checkloop runs `caffeinate` for
                       the lifetime of the run so the host does not idle-sleep
                       mid-check (sleep suspends the active Claude subprocess
                       and the run appears stalled). No effect off macOS.
--dry-run              Preview without running
--no-resume            Ignore any existing checkpoint and start fresh
--verbose, -v          Show operational events, timing, and memory info
--debug                Show all details including raw subprocess output
--pause SECS           Pause between checks (default: 2)
--changed-only [REF]   Only check files that changed vs a base ref.
                       With no argument, auto-detects main/master.
                       Pass a branch or SHA to compare against.
--dangerously-skip-permissions
                       Pass --dangerously-skip-permissions to Claude Code
                       (bypasses all permission checks)
--convergence-threshold PCT
                       Stop cycling early when less than PCT% of total lines
                       changed in a cycle (default: 0.1). Requires a git repo.
                       Set to 0 to disable convergence detection.
--model, -m MODEL      Override the model for ALL checks. Accepts aliases
                       ('sonnet', 'opus') or full model IDs ('claude-sonnet-4-6').
                       When omitted, each check uses the model from the plan file.
--claude-command CMD   Name or path of the Claude CLI executable to invoke
                       (default: 'claude'). Useful when multiple Claude
                       installations exist, e.g. 'claude-bedrock'.
--allow-ai-attribution Allow AI tool mentions and Co-Authored-By trailers
                       in commit messages. By default, commit messages omit
                       any reference to AI tools.
--require-base-fresh DURATION
                       Reject the run if the review base commit is older
                       than DURATION (e.g. 30m, 12h, 1d, 1w). Guards against
                       starting a review against a stale base where
                       extractions and refactors will need manual
                       re-application against current upstream HEAD. Pass
                       'ignore' or omit the flag to disable the check.
--no-fetch-upstream    Skip the network fetch from the real remote that runs
                       after clone-mode setup. By default, when a real
                       remote (typically GitHub) is configured, checkloop
                       fetches from it once at startup so the scratch branch
                       is based on current upstream HEAD rather than the
                       user's possibly-stale local mirror. Pass this flag to
                       keep the run fully offline.
```

## How It Works

`checkloop` is a modular Python CLI that orchestrates Claude Code as a subprocess. Here is the high-level flow:

1. **Argument resolution** — Parses CLI flags, loads the plan file (or resolves manual check selection), and validates the target directory.
2. **Clone preparation** (unless `--in-place`) — Makes a hardlink-backed `git clone --local` of `--dir` into `~/checkloop-runs/<target>-<iso-timestamp>/`, runs `git fetch origin --prune` in the clone, resolves the `--review-branch` ref (preferring `origin/<name>` over any local branch), and checks it out in detached-HEAD state so commits can't be pushed upstream. After the checkout, the original repo's Claude auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/<original-slug>/memory/`) is copied into the clone's slug so the check sessions inherit project context — read-only, with any writes during the run intentionally orphaned in the clone's slug rather than persisted back into the user's authoritative memory.
3. **Scratch branch** — Creates `<review-branch>-cl-<iso-timestamp>` (or `checkloop-<iso-timestamp>` in `--in-place` mode) off the current HEAD and switches to it. All checkloop commits land on this branch; the user's original branches are untouched.
3a. **Power assertion** (macOS only) — Spawns `caffeinate -i -m -s` bound to checkloop's PID so the host does not idle-sleep mid-run; the assertion is released automatically when checkloop exits. Disable with `--no-caffeinate`. If `caffeinate` is not on `PATH`, checkloop prints a warning and continues without the assertion.
4. **Pre-run warning** — Displays a 5-second countdown so the user can abort. Warns if `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is (or isn't) set.
5. **Check execution** — For each check, builds a focused prompt (with commit-message rules appended) and invokes `claude -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose` as a subprocess.
6. **Real-time streaming** — Streams JSONL output from the subprocess, displaying tool-use events (file reads, edits, shell commands) and assistant messages with elapsed-time prefixes.
7. **Idle timeout** — If Claude produces no output for N seconds (default 600), the watchdog consults two forgiveness signals before killing: live descendants in the process tree, and per-tree CPU activity. When both are present the kill is suppressed entirely (only `--check-timeout` bounds total runtime). When only one is present the window extends to 2× the configured timeout. With neither (the typical sub-agent / extended-thinking case where the parent process sits on a long API call with no children and no CPU), the kill is suppressed entirely — that tier proved to be a false-positive factory in the 2026-05-02 post-mortem, so `--check-timeout` is the wall-clock safety net there. A `status=compacting` SDK event also suppresses the kill in every tier until compaction completes.
8. **Hard timeout & memory limit** — Optional hard wall-clock timeout (`--check-timeout`) kills checks regardless of output. Memory monitoring (`--max-memory-mb`, default 8192) samples child tree RSS every 10 seconds and kills the process group if it exceeds the limit. A separate host-wide floor (`--system-free-floor-mb`, default 500) kills the running check if free system memory drops below MB — a safety net for swap-thrash stalls. When a kill fires, a "top offender" line names the single largest process (pid, RSS, command) so you can see what went wrong without re-reading the full log.
9. **Checkpointing** — After each check, saves progress to `.checkloop-checkpoint.json` inside the clone (or the `--dir` in `--in-place` mode). If interrupted, the next run offers to resume from where it left off.
10. **Per-check change detection** — After each check, compares the git HEAD before/after to report how many lines changed. All checks run every cycle so that cascading improvements are never missed.
11. **Convergence detection** — After each full cycle, measures what percentage of total tracked lines were modified. If below the threshold, the loop exits early. Per-check commits are preserved individually for easier debugging.
12. **Adoption summary** — On completion (or interrupt) the terminal prints a single copy-paste prompt for a Claude session in the original repo. That session inspects the scratch branch in the clone (read-only, no `git fetch`), applies project standards, and re-applies any genuine improvements as fresh commits in the original repo on new branches — then tests, pushes, opens a PR, and merges through the original repo's normal workflow. The clone is never used as a push origin and its commits are never cherry-picked.
13. **Process cleanup** — Each Claude subprocess runs in its own process group (`setsid`). On completion or timeout, the entire group is killed (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) to prevent orphaned child processes from leaking memory. An atexit handler sweeps all tracked sessions on program exit. A pre-cleanup state snapshot is appended to `~/.checkloop/cleanup-debug.log` so post-mortem debugging survives a terminal death.
14. **Telemetry** — A background sampler writes one JSONL line every ~3 seconds to `<run-dir>/.checkloop-telemetry/telemetry-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (where `<run-dir>` is the clone dir in clone mode, or a fresh `~/checkloop-runs/<target>-<iso>/` dir in `--in-place` mode) with parent RSS, child-tree RSS, top 5 processes, system free memory, swap, and the active check label. The file survives crashes and OOM kills, so timelines are available even when the terminal dies. See [Observability](#observability).

Each check operates on the code left by the previous check, so improvements compound: a readability check renames variables, then the DRY check can spot the newly-visible duplication, and so on.

### Key internal functions

| Function | Role |
|----------|------|
| `main()` | CLI entry point — parses args, resolves checks, runs the suite |
| `run_claude()` | Public API to run a single Claude Code check |
| `_run_check_suite()` | Orchestrates all checks across all cycles |
| `_stream_process_output()` | Streams and parses JSONL from the Claude subprocess |
| `_check_cycle_convergence()` | Checks if the loop should stop based on change percentage |
| `_kill_process_group()` | Terminates a subprocess and all its children |

## AI Attribution in Commit Messages

By default, checkloop instructs Claude to **omit** AI references (tool names, Co-Authored-By trailers) from commit messages. To allow AI attribution, pass `--allow-ai-attribution`:

```bash
uv run checkloop --dir ~/my-project --allow-ai-attribution
```

When enabled, Claude may include Co-Authored-By trailers and mention AI tools in commit messages.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Required by Claude Code for authentication. Must be set before running `checkloop`. See the [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for setup. |
| `CLAUDECODE` | Automatically stripped by `checkloop` when spawning subprocesses. This allows `checkloop` to be invoked from within a Claude Code session without conflict. You do not need to set this yourself. |

No other environment variables or config files are required. All configuration is done via CLI flags.

## Log File

Every run writes a DEBUG-level log to `<run-dir>/.checkloop-run.log`. `<run-dir>` is the clone directory under `~/checkloop-runs/<target>-<iso-timestamp>/` in clone mode, or a fresh `~/checkloop-runs/<target>-<iso-timestamp>/` directory in `--in-place` mode (so in-place runs don't pollute the target repo either). The log captures detailed operational data — prompt text, subprocess timing, memory measurements, and error traces — useful for post-run debugging. Previous logs are rotated to `.log.1`, `.log.2`, `.log.3`, and files are created with owner-only permissions (0600) since they may contain sensitive content.

## Observability

Long autonomous runs fail in ways that are hard to diagnose after the fact: the process tree balloons, the terminal dies, or a check hangs for an hour on a single test. `checkloop` writes three out-of-band signals that survive those failures.

### Telemetry JSONL

A background thread samples the process tree every ~3 seconds and appends one JSON line per sample to `<run-dir>/.checkloop-telemetry/telemetry-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (the clone directory in clone mode, or a fresh `~/checkloop-runs/<target>-<iso>/` dir in `--in-place` mode). Each sample includes:

- `parent_rss_mb`, `children_rss_mb` — checkloop itself and the total of its descendants (recursive walk, so grandchildren like `pytest` / `python` / `grep` are included)
- `top_children` — up to the top 5 processes by RSS, with `pid`, `rss_mb`, and `cmd`
- `system_free_mb`, `swap_used_mb` — host-level memory pressure signals
- `label` — which check was active at that moment (e.g. `cycle 1 · security`)
- `run_id`, `iso`, `t` — correlation and timing

Because the file is flushed + fsynced on every write and lives outside `.checkloop-run.log` (which rotates per-run), telemetry **survives crashes, OOM kills, and reboots**. To inspect a stall or kill after the fact:

```bash
# Last 20 samples
tail -20 .checkloop-telemetry/telemetry-2026-04-17.jsonl | jq .

# Timeline of child tree RSS and top offender
jq -r '[.iso, .children_rss_mb, (.top_children[0] // {}) | .cmd] | @tsv' \
  .checkloop-telemetry/telemetry-2026-04-17.jsonl
```

Retention is automatic: per-run directories under `~/checkloop-runs/` older than 14 days are pruned at the start of the next run, and within each run's telemetry directory, files older than 14 days drop and the directory is capped at 200 MB.

### Top-offender alert

When a memory-limit or system-pressure kill fires, checkloop emits a one-line alert naming the single largest process in the tree at the moment of the kill:

```
  → top offender: pid=54321 rss=6821MB cmd=node /opt/claude/.../claude-code
```

This is the first thing to look at when a kill is unexpected — it's usually one runaway language server or test worker rather than the whole tree.

### Cleanup debug log

On process-tree cleanup (check end, timeout, kill, or program exit), a state snapshot is appended to `~/.checkloop/cleanup-debug.log`:

```
2026-04-17T08:10:37  pid=29897 ppid=29880 sessions=[29897] descendants=[29910, 29914, 29918]
```

This lives in `$HOME`, not the project, so it survives `rm -rf` of a workdir and outlives any single run. Use it to reconstruct what the process tree looked like at the moment things went wrong — essential when the terminal itself died and the in-memory log is gone.

### Inline quiet status

When Claude runs a subprocess silently (a long `pytest`, a large `grep`, a build), the idle display after ~15 s shows tree RSS, the current top process, and host free memory alongside the elapsed time — so a silent but healthy run is visibly distinct from a stalled one.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed and authenticated
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

## Development

```bash
# Clone and install dev dependencies
git clone https://github.com/alexander-marquardt/checkloop.git
cd checkloop
uv sync --dev

# Run the test suite
uv run pytest

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/checkloop/

# Run checkloop on itself (dogfooding)
uv run checkloop --dir . --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

The project has no runtime dependencies — only `pytest` and `mypy` in the dev group.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `claude` not found | Install Claude Code: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. If you have a non-standard install (e.g. `claude-bedrock`), use `--claude-command` to specify the executable name. |
| Checks hang waiting for permission prompts | You must use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — checkloop cannot relay interactive prompts |
| "CLAUDECODE" conflict when running inside a Claude session | checkloop automatically strips this variable; no action needed |
| Convergence detection not working | Ensure the project directory is a git repo (`git init` if needed) |
| High memory usage over many checks | checkloop kills orphaned child processes between checks and enforces an 8GB RSS limit by default. Adjust with `--max-memory-mb`, raise the host-wide floor with `--system-free-floor-mb`, or use `--verbose` to monitor RSS. For post-mortem, inspect `<run-dir>/.checkloop-telemetry/telemetry-*.jsonl` under `~/checkloop-runs/` — see [Observability](#observability) |
| A check hung or was killed and you want to know why | Check the `top offender` line in `<run-dir>/.checkloop-run.log`, then walk the timeline in `<run-dir>/.checkloop-telemetry/telemetry-*.jsonl`. If the terminal itself died, `~/.checkloop/cleanup-debug.log` has the last process-tree snapshot |
| Idle timeout kills a check too early | Inspect the kill line in `<run-dir>/.checkloop-run.log` — the `descendants=N, busy_ratio=…` fields reveal which tier fired. The no-signal tier (`descendants=0, busy_ratio=0.00`) no longer kills at all; if a kill fired with descendants alive, the partial-signal tier hit its 2× cap, meaning a quiescent subprocess (e.g. a hung language server) was holding the tree without making progress. Raise `--idle-timeout` to widen that cap, or set `--check-timeout 7200` for a wall-clock bound that covers any silent agent work |
| A check runs too long | Use `--check-timeout 3600` for a hard 1-hour wall-clock limit per check |
| Want to start fresh after an interrupted run | Use `--no-resume` to skip the checkpoint prompt |
