label: "Schema Validation at Boundaries"

Every byte crossing into the system from the outside — HTTP request bodies, query/path params, webhook payloads, message queue bodies, file uploads, external API responses — must be parsed and validated against a schema before being used. This is not "does a function named `validate*` exist"; it's "can an untyped blob of JSON reach business logic".

1. **Enumerate boundaries.** Find every place the application ingests external data:
   - HTTP endpoint handlers (Express routes, FastAPI path operations, Django views, Rails controllers, Go `http.HandleFunc`, etc.)
   - Webhook receivers (Stripe, GitHub, Slack, custom)
   - Message/queue consumers (SQS, Kafka, Redis streams, RabbitMQ)
   - File/upload processors
   - Responses from external APIs that the code deserializes and uses
   - Environment variable parsing at startup
   - **Config files** read at startup or on reload — TOML, YAML, JSON, INI, `.env` files, `*.config.{js,ts}` modules, plugin/extension manifests, and any user-editable file whose contents are loaded into application state. A `toml.load(path)` or `yaml.safe_load(f)` whose result is indexed with raw `cfg["section"]["key"]` is a boundary with no schema, even though nothing crosses the network. The failure mode is a typo or missing key that crashes at first use instead of at boot, and a malformed value type (string where an int was expected) that silently misbehaves.

2. **For each boundary, check for a schema.** Acceptable shapes:
   - **TypeScript/JavaScript:** Zod, Yup, io-ts, Joi, ArkType, Valibot. `req.body as MyType` is NOT validation — it's a type assertion.
   - **Python:** Pydantic models, `marshmallow`, `dataclass` + `cattrs`, FastAPI path-op types (which use Pydantic under the hood).
   - **Go:** `encoding/json` + explicit struct tags + a validator library (`go-playground/validator` or similar); `json.Unmarshal` alone doesn't validate, only shape-matches.
   - **Rust:** `serde` + explicit type with validation, or `validator` crate.

3. **Check failure modes.** A validator that throws a generic 500 on bad input is almost as bad as no validator. Each boundary should:
   - Return a structured 4xx with a useful error message (field path + reason)
   - Log the validation failure with enough context to debug (without logging the raw payload if it may contain secrets)
   - Not leak implementation details (don't return the raw Pydantic traceback to an external caller)

4. **Check external API responses.** When the code deserializes a response from Stripe/GitHub/etc. and uses fields from it, it should tolerate missing fields and schema drift. A `response.json()["amount"]` that crashes when the external API adds/removes fields is brittle. Parse external responses through a schema that accepts "extra" fields but fails loudly on missing required ones.

5. **Check env/config parsing.** App startup is a boundary too. Config should be parsed through a schema (Pydantic Settings, Zod `.parse(process.env)`, `envconfig` in Go) so missing/malformed env vars fail at boot, not at first use. The same rule applies to file-based config: a project that loads `config.toml` / `settings.yaml` / `plugin.json` and threads the raw dict through the codebase has the same drift and typo risk as raw `process.env` access. Wrap the loaded structure in the project's existing schema library (Pydantic model for Python, Zod schema for TS, a `Config` struct with `serde` for Rust, etc.) at the point of load. Where a file is structurally a config but is *intentionally* validated lazily — e.g. a plugin manifest where the host validates only the fields it consumes, leaving plugin-specific keys free-form — flag it for review rather than fixing; that is a design choice, not an omission.

6. **Check webhook signatures.** Webhook receivers must verify the signature header before parsing the body. If a Stripe/GitHub/Slack webhook handler reads the body without a signature check, that's a high-severity gap — flag and fix.

7. **Flag missing runtime validation at internal seams — do not add it.** The boundaries above guard data entering from *outside*. The same drift happens *inside* the system wherever two components must agree on a shape but evolve independently — the backend response a frontend consumes, a producer/consumer pair across a queue, one service calling another. A shared TypeScript type or a hand-kept interface is a *compile-time* promise that says nothing at runtime once the producer's actual output drifts from what the consumer expects; the mismatch then surfaces as wrong behavior three layers downstream instead of at the seam. Where such a seam exists with no runtime contract check, **note it in your report** — naming the seam and the consuming side that would validate — rather than generating a validator. Standing up wire-contract validation is net-new functionality and a design call for the maintainer (which side validates, one shared schema vs two, how strict), not an in-pass fix. The end state worth recommending is a single shared schema both sides import, the same source-of-truth rule any derived value follows.

8. **Reject unknown input fields — don't silently drop them.** For data the caller *sends in* (request bodies, query params, command payloads), an unrecognized or misspelled field must fail loudly, not be quietly ignored. A schema configured to discard extras — Pydantic's default `extra="ignore"`, a handler that iterates known keys and `continue`s past the rest, a manual parse that only reads the fields it recognizes — turns a client's typo (`?catgory=` for `?category=`) or a stale field name into a silent no-op: the filter is never applied, the flag never takes effect, and the failure surfaces as "wrong results" far downstream instead of a clear error at the seam. This is the inbound mirror of point 4: *external API responses* you consume should tolerate extra fields (forward-compatibility), but *user input* you accept should reject them. Fix: set the schema to forbid extras (`extra="forbid"` / Zod `.strict()` / a validator that errors on unknown keys) and return a structured 422 that names the unknown field and lists the legal set, so the caller learns immediately. Exempt genuinely open-ended maps (a documented free-form metadata/labels object) — those are meant to accept arbitrary keys.

**What to fix:**
- Add schema validation at every boundary that lacks it. Prefer the library already used in the project.
- Make inbound schemas reject unknown fields with a specific 422; keep outbound/external-response schemas tolerant of extras.
- Route validation failures to the structured 4xx path, not a generic 500.
- Do NOT over-validate trusted internal-only boundaries (service-to-service calls within a private VPC, for instance) if the project explicitly trusts them — flag, don't fix.
- Do NOT invent a new validation library when the project already has one in use elsewhere.

Safety-sensitive symbols (`isSafe*|validate*|sanitize*|escape*|auth*|permission*|encrypt*|decrypt*|verify*`) on boundary paths get extra scrutiny — they must have tests covering both the happy path and a representative set of invalid inputs.

Run the test suite after adding validators. Report boundaries found, which were unvalidated, and what was added.
